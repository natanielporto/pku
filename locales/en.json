    "question1": "What is PKU?",
    "answer1": "Phenilketonuria (PKU, in English) is a methabolic disease caused by an inherited error in the metabolism of amino acids, which occurs by recessive autosomal inheritance. This means that the child needs to receive an altered gene from the mother and another from the father to develop the disorder. With this condition, the person must have special care with their health when it comes to food and the types of foods ingested, which are strictly restricted in variety and quantity.",
    "question2": "Where do the images on the recipescome from? Are they real?",
    "answer2": "The images are purely illustrative and come from the www.unsplash.com website. They are a way to illustrate the recipes, but not perfectly equal to the final result. They can be used as a suggestion for preparation, for example. But never forget: always put your personal touch on the presentation of the dishes and drinks.",
    "question3": "Suggestions and criticisms?",
    "answer3": "Send an email with your recipe, what you thought of the app, if it is useful for you, or anything you want to: xxxxx@gmail.com",
    "question4": "How was the app translated to English?",
    "answer4": "We used AI to translate the app to English. So if you find any mistakes, please let us know."
